tools and scripts i wrote that are helpful in doing scientific computing, especially in maintaining records of experiments and results.
you'll want to place the files in some accessible directory that is part of your pythonpath, such as /home/yourname/scripts.
and then add this directory to your shell login like so:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/scripts:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/scripts:$PYTHONPATH"
```
